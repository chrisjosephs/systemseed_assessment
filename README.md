# What is this?

It is a Drupal module. It's expected to be used as a prerequisite for technical assessment execution as a part of recruitment process for Drupal engineers at SystemSeed.

# What are the dependencies?

A local development environment with:

- [Drupal core 9](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal)
- [Paragraphs module](https://www.drupal.org/project/paragraphs)

# How to install it?

It's a usual Drupal module, so you can install it either:

- [Using composer](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/using-composer/using-composer-to-install-drupal-and-manage-dependencies#adding-modules) (you will need to specify a [custom repository](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/using-composer/using-composer-to-install-drupal-and-manage-dependencies#third-party-libraries))
- Download the repository as a ZIP archive and unarchive into a folder with modules

# Where to find a task for technical assessment?

It will be sent to you privately by SystemSeed's HR or other team member responsible for your technical assessment.

# Got other questions?

Don't hesitate to reach out to us. Seriously. We're an open team always happy to help.
If you haven't been added to our open Slack channel yet then ask our HR to get you added there.

And hey, good luck with the assessment :-)
