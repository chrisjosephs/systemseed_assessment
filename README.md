# How to install it?

Clone the git repository into the folder with custom Drupal modules and then install it as a usual Drupal module.
All necessary configurations will be imported on installation automatically.

# Where to find a task for technical assessment?

It will be sent to you privately by SystemSeed's HR or other team member responsible for your technical assessment.

# Got other questions?

Don't hesitate to reach out to us. Seriously. We're an open team always happy to help.
