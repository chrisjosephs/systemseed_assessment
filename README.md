# What are the dependencies?

# How to use / install?

It's a usual Drupal module, so you can install it either:
- [Using composer](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/using-composer/using-composer-to-install-drupal-and-manage-dependencies#adding-modules) (you will need to specify a [custom repository](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/using-composer/using-composer-to-install-drupal-and-manage-dependencies#third-party-libraries))
- Download the repository as a ZIP archive and unarchive into a folder with modules

# Where to find a task for technical assessment?

It will be given privately by SystemSeed's HR or other team member responsible for your technical assessment.
