Observations:

Unpkg librararies in libraries.yml pointing at non-existing version resources.  Fixed.
The todo list does not have a character cap (therefore tested it with a character cap)
Tested html tags are not rendered as Drupal states on the admin > content > edit paragraph page, even with the dangerouslysetinnerhtml in the application.js renderer, and this is ok you just see the unparsed < tags /> as expected
